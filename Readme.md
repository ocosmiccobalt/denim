# Denim

This is the site for Nîmes, an online denim store (HTML, SCSS, JS).

To implement a search field hidden behind a single icon, I rely on the approach shown in this article: [Adrian Roselli. Responsive Progressive Accessible Vanilla Search](https://adrianroselli.com/2015/12/responsive-progressive-accessible-vanilla-search.html).

In creating the accordion and carousel, I try not to make things worse with WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties. For this I use some articles and videos:

- [Accordion Pattern (Sections With Show/Hide Functionality)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/)
- [Carousel (Slide Show or Image Rotator) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/)
- [MDN web docs: aria-disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-disabled)
- [Sandrina Pereira. Making Disabled Buttons More Inclusive](https://css-tricks.com/making-disabled-buttons-more-inclusive/)
- [Доступная карусель - Юлия Долгун - Accessibility Club Minsk Meetup #1](https://youtu.be/DAO9_bXCTuk)

The answer to the question of how to make a slider with two thumbs I found here: [Ana Tudor. Multi-Thumb Sliders: Particular Two-Thumb Case](https://css-tricks.com/multi-thumb-sliders-particular-two-thumb-case/).
